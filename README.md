## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of the FastDDS-based middleware system designed for remote X-ray image classification on a Raspberry Pi. The paper explores a robust system architecture that allows for real-time image transmission, inference, and feedback between nodes over a FastDDS communication framework.

The system processes X-ray images, performs inference on the Raspberry Pi, and sends classification results back to the origin node, enabling seamless interaction and processing in real-time environments.

## Code Availability
The code supporting this paper will be made publicly available after the completion of the review process.
